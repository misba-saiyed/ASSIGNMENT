      <li> No,Tags are within <> brackets whereas elements includes opening tag,content & closing tag.
            
            
            HTML Tags: Tags are the starting and ending parts of an HTML element. They begin with < symbol and end with > symbol. Whatever written inside < and > are called tags.
            
            
            
             Example: 
             
            
            
            <b> </b>


            HTML elements: Elements enclose the contents in between the tags. They consist of some kind of structure or expression. It generally consists of a start tag, content and an end tag.
           
            Example: 
 

            <b>This is the content.</b>
                 
                        </li><br>



         <li>A tag is a way of representing an HTML element in the program, while an attribute is a way of describing the characteristics of an HTML element.
           - HTML contains various elements to build the content. Elements such as paragraph, horizontal lines and headings are used to develop the structure of all webpages. Programmer cannot write these elements directly on the website. He has to use tags to write specific elements to the webpage. 
           - Attribute provides extra information about an HTML element. It has two sections: the name of the attribute and the value of that attribute.The name defines the property that we require to set, while the value is a property that defines the value of that property. The programmer can write the value inside quotations.
           <p id="para1">This is a paragraph.</p></li><br>

         <li>A void element is an element whose content model never allows it to have contents under any circumstances. Void elements can have attributes. The following is a complete list of the void elements in HTML : area , base , br , col , command , embed , hr , img , input , keygen , link , meta , param , source , track , wbr.
             HTML5 currently adds:

            -command
            -keygen
            -source</li><br>

            
            <li>An HTML entity is a piece of text ("string") that begins with an ampersand ( & ) and ends with a semicolon ( ; ). Entities are frequently used to display reserved characters which would otherwise be interpreted as HTML code, and invisible characters like non-breaking spaces.
              Generally, you don't need to use HTML entities if your editor supports Unicode. For some instances, entities can be useful: Your editor does not support Unicode. Your keyboard does not support the character you would like to type, such as em-dash or the copyright symbol.
            </li><br>

            <li>There are three types of lists in HTML:<br>
               -Unordered list or Bulleted list (ul):In HTML unordered list, the list items have no specific order or sequence. An unordered list is also called a Bulleted list, as the items are marked with bullets. <br>
              
               Example of HTML Unordered List:-
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
   <head>
      <title>HTML Unordered List</title>
   </head>	
   <body>
   <h2>List of Fruits</h2>
      <ul>
         <li>Apple</li>
         <li>Mango</li>
         <li>Banana</li>
         <li>Grapes</li>
         <li>Orange</li>
      </ul>
   </body>  
</html><br>

               -Ordered list or Numbered list (ol):Ordered List or Numbered List (ol)
               In HTML, all the list items in an ordered list are marked with numbers by default instead of bullets. <br>
               Example of HTML Ordered List:-
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
   <head>
      <title>HTML Ordered List</title>
   </head>	
   <body>
   <h2>List of Fruits</h2>
      <ol>
         <li>Apple</li>
         <li>Mango</li>
         <li>Banana</li>
         <li>Grapes</li>
         <li>Orange</li>
      </ol>
   </body>  
</html><br>

               -Description list or Definition list (dl):A definition list is a list of terms and corresponding definitions. Definition lists are typically formatted with the term on the left with the definition following on the right or on the next line. The definition text is typically indented with respect to the term.<br>
               Example:-
               <!DOCTYPE html>
               <html>
                  <head>
                     <title>HTML defination List</title>
                  </head>	
                  <body>
                  <h2>List of beverages</h2>
  <dl>
  <dt>Coffee</dt>
  <dd>- black hot drink</dd>
  <dt>Milk</dt>
  <dd>- white cold drink</dd>
</dl></li><br>

<li>The class attribute specifies one or more classnames for an element. The class attribute is mostly used to point to a class in a style sheet. However, it can also be used by a JavaScript (via the HTML DOM) to make changes to HTML elements with a specified class.<br>
  
  Example:-

  <!DOCTYPE html>
  <html>
  <head>
      <title>Country</title>
  </head>
  <body>
      <h2 class="country">CHINA</h2>
       
  <p>China has the largest population
         in the world.</p>
   
      <h2 class="country">INDIA</h2>
       
  <p>India has the second largest
         population in the world.</p>
   
      <h2 class="country">UNITED STATES</h2>
       
  <p>United States has the third largest
         population in the world.</p>
   
  </body>
  </html>
</li><br>

<li>Difference between id and class attribute: The only difference between them is that “id” is unique in a page and can only apply to at most one element, while “class” selector can apply to multiple elements.</li><br>


<li>HTML provides many predefined elements that are used to change the formatting of text. The formatting can be used to set the text styles (like – bold, italic, or emphasized, etc.), highlighting the text, making text superscript and subscript,etc.<br>
  <Example:-
  <!DOCTYPE html>
  <html>
    
  <head>
      <title>Bold and strong</title>
  </head>
    
  <body>
      <!--Normal text-->
      <p>Normal Text</p>
    
      <!--Text in Bold-->
      <p><b>Bold Text</b></p>
    
      <!--Text in Strong-->
      <p><strong> Strong Text</strong></p>
  </body>
    
  </html>
</li><br>

<li>Cellpadding basically defines the space present between a table cell's border and the content present in it. Cellspacing basically defines the space present between individual adjacent cells.</li><br>

<li>You can merge two or more table cells in a column using the colspan attribute in a <td> HTML tag (table data). To merge two or more row cells, use the rowspan attribute.<br>
   </li><br>

<li>Block elements always start from a new line. Inline elements never start from a new line. Block elements cover space from left to right as far as it can go. Inline elements only cover the space as bounded by the tags in the HTML element</li><br>

<li>To make a hyperlink in an HTML page, use the anchor start tag and anchor end tags, which are the tags used to define the links. The anchor tag indicates where the hyperlink starts and the anchor end tag indicates where it ends. Whatever text gets added inside these tags, will work as a hyperlink.</li><br>

<li>The iframe (in brackets)tag specifies an inline frame. An inline frame is used to embed another document within the current HTML document.</li><br>

<li>The span in brackets tag is an inline container used to mark up a part of a text, or a part of a document. e.g.The span tag is easily styled by CSS or manipulated with JavaScript using the class or id attribute. The span tag is much like the div element, but div is a block-level element and span is an inline element.</li><br>

<li>To insert an image in HTML, use the image tag and include a source and alt attribute. Like any other HTML element, you'll add images to the body section of your HTML file. The HTML image element is an “empty element,” meaning it does not have a closing tag.</li><br>

<li>Normal links are unvisited links generally shown in blue color in most of the websites. A link becomes active when you click on it. However the color of the links may vary as they can be customized.</li><br>

<li>There are three tags that can be used to separate the texts:<br>
 <br> - br tag : Usually br tag is used to separate the line of text. It breaks the current line and conveys the flow to the next line.<br>
  - p tag : This contains the text in the form of a new paragraph.<br>
  -blockquote tag :It is used to define a large quoted section.</li><br>

  <li>-SVG stands for Scalable Vector Graphics<br>
      -SVG is used to define vector-based graphics for the Web<br>
      -SVG defines the graphics in XML format<br>
      -Every element and every attribute in SVG files can be animated<br>
      -SVG is a W3C recommendation<br>
      -SVG integrates with other W3C standards such as the DOM and XSL.</li><br>

      <li>HTML is the standard markup language for creating web pages, while XHTML is a stricter and more standardized version of HTML. Both HTML and XHTML include a wide range of features, such as support for multimedia, styling, and scripting.XHTML was developed to make HTML more extensible and flexible to work with other data formats (such as XML). So XHTML comes with a much stricter error handling.
      </li><br>

      <li>Physical and Logical tags are used in HTML for better visibility and understanding of the text by the user on the web page. However, both tags differ from each other as suggested by their names.

        <br>-Logical Tags: Logical Tags are used in HTML to display the text according to the logical styles.e.gdefines text,long quotation,etc.<br>-Physical Tags: Physical Tags are used in HTML to provide actual physical formatting to the text.e.g. defines bold,big text,etc.</li>
